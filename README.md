# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

**CodSoft - Data Science Internship Project**

## üìå Project Overview

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project aims to analyze and predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. Leveraging historical passenger data (e.g., age, gender, class), this project builds a machine learning model to estimate the likelihood of survival for individuals on the ship.

## üìÇ Dataset

* **Dataset Used**: [Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
* Contains information such as:

  * `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `Pandas` & `NumPy` - Data cleaning & manipulation
  * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` - Data visualization
  * `Scikit-learn` - Machine learning modeling & evaluation

## üìä Project Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Understand feature distributions (e.g., Age, Fare, Gender)
* Visualizations to explore survival correlations:

  * Survival rate by gender
  * Survival rate by class
  * Age vs Survival distributions

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)
* Encoding categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`) using One-Hot Encoding
* Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
* Feature engineering (e.g., Family size from `SibSp` + `Parch`)

### 3. Model Selection & Training

* Models considered:

  * Logistic Regression ‚úÖ (selected)
  * Decision Tree
  * k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
* Logistic Regression was chosen for its:

  * Interpretability
  * Robustness
  * Good performance on binary classification

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Performance metrics:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1 Score
* Validation: Cross-validation used for robust evaluation

### 5. Deployment (Optional)

* Model ready for integration into a user-facing application (e.g., web app)
* Can make predictions on new/unseen passenger data
